# Rijul Sarin 👋
### Senior Product Manager | AI Systems Architect | First-Principles Builder

I am a Senior Product Manager with 10+ years of experience leading high-scale product initiatives at **Amazon** and **Cisco**. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex technical infrastructure and customer-centric value, with a current focus on **Agentic Workflows** and **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## 🧠 Strategic Mental Models
I approach product building through the lens of a seasoned PM who values long-term viability over short-term hype:

* **First-Principles Decomposition:** Breaking down nebulous "AI goals" into atomic, measurable system requirements.
* **The "Agency" Spectrum:** Strategizing where to deploy autonomous agents vs. human-in-the-loop workflows to balance speed with high-stakes reliability.
* **Economic Moats in AI:** Designing products where the value lies in proprietary context, superior orchestration, and user-retention loops, not just the underlying LLM.

**🎯 2026 Goal:** *To pioneer the transition from **Traditional Product Management** to **Agentic Orchestration**. My mission is to build a repository of 'First-Principles' frameworks and autonomous agents that prove AI isn't just a feature, but a teammate capable of high-stakes reasoning and execution.*
